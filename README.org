* evil-matchit (current version 1.1.0)

Vim [[http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=39][matchit.vim]] by Benji Fisher ported into Emacs.

When it's installed, you can press "%" to jump between matched tags in Emacs.

Most modern languages are supported. htm, python, java,c++, c, javascript, perl, latex, just to name a few.

This package uses Evil as its vi layer!

* Why use evil-matchit 
- No learning curve. You only need press "%" to jump between matched tags. That's all!
- Support any modern languages (html/java/c/c++/python/latex/javascript ...).
- Powerful. For example, if you mix jsp, freemarker, html, jquery template or any wierd sytax into one file, evil-matchit still works!
- Extendable. You can write a plugin for it in 5 minutes.
- Many languages will be supported soon.
- I will provide long term support for it (say next 10 years) because Emacs is my last editor.

Here is screen cast for python:

* Install
evil-matchit is already uploaded to [[http://marmalade-repo.org/]]. So the best way to install it is using Emacs' package manager.

* Set up
Insert below code into your ~/.emacs:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(require 'evil-matchit)
(global-evil-matchit-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

Alternatively, you can enable evil-matchit-mode along a major mode by adding `turn-on-evil-matchit-mode' to the mode hook.

* Usage
Press "%" to jump inside item(s) between tags in evil-normal-mode whose command name is "evilmi-jump-items". Please note that you *DO NOT* need move cursor above the tag before jumping, evil-matchit is smart enough to *detect the beginning of tag automatically*.

Press ",si" to select item(s) wrapped by tags in evil-normal-mode whose command name is "evilmi-select-items".

Press ",di" to delete item(s) wrapped by tags in evil-normal-mode whose command name is "evilmi-delete-items".

All commands support numeric argument like "3%", "5,si" or "9,di"

* Advanced tips
** Support more major modes
Let's use html tag matching as an example.

html tags are automatically supported in sgml-mode, nxml-mode, web-mode, html-mode and nxhtml-mode,.

Let's say you want a new major-mode "my-mode" to do the html tag matching. Easy. Please add below line into your ~/.emacs:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(plist-put evilmi-plugins my-mode '((evilmi-html-get-tag evilmi-html-jump)))
#+END_SRC

Further explanation: "evilmi-html-get-tag" and "evilmi-html-jump" are existing APIs which are defined in evil-matchit-html.el. The above line means that in my-mode, use "evilmi-html-get-tag" to find open/closed tag in current line and use "evilmi-html-jump" to jump to matched closed/open tag.

** mixed languages in one html template file can be supported
Say you embed python language in a html file. You can match both html tags and python statement by inserting below code into your ~/.emacs:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(plist-put evilmi-plugins web-mode
           '((evilmi-python-get-tag evilmi-python-jump)
             (evilmi-html-get-tag evilmi-html-jump)
             ))
#+END_SRC
** re-define keybinding
You can define your own key bindings instead using evil-matchit default key binding.

All you need to do is define function evilmi-customize-keybinding before turning on evil-mathcit-mode:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun evilmi-customize-keybinding ()
  (evil-define-key 'normal evil-matchit-mode-map
    "%" 'evilmi-jump-items
    ",si" 'evilmi-select-items
    ",di" 'evilmi-delete-items
    )
  )
(global-evil-matchit-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

* Developer guide
** Writing elisp code to support a new language
Simple. All you need to is define two functions and tell evil-matchit in which major-mode they should be used.

Here is a complete sample:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;; detect tag in current line and return the result in variable rlt
;; the rlt will be used by evilmi-mylanguage-jump as the first
;; parameter.
;; if NO tag found, the rlt SHOULD be nil
;;
;; @return the data to be used by evilmi-mylanguage-jump which should be a list
;;         the first element of the list is the position of cursor before jump
;;         we use it to select/delete tag. The other elements of the list could
;;         be any data type
(defun evilmi-mylanguage-find-tag ()
  (let (rlt )
    (setq rlt '(position-of-open-end "anything-you-like" "anything-you-like")
    rlt
    )
  )

;; @parama rlt result from evilmi-mylanguage-find-tag
;; @param NUM numeric argument when user press "%" to match tag
;; @return the matching tag position in theory, useful only for
;;         selecting or deleting text between matching tags and tags
(defun evilmi-mylanguage-jump (rlt NUM)
  (message "rlt=%s" rlt)
  ;; if we need select region between tags (including tags itself)
  ;; we get the beginning of region by reading the first element of
  ;; rlt
  (push-mark (nth 0 rlt) t t)
  ;; say 999 is the where we jump to
  (goto-char 999)
  ;; If you need know where is the end of the region for region operation,
  ;; you need return the end of region at the end of function
  ;; region operation means selection/deletion of region.
  888
  )

;; tell evil-matchit how to use above functions
(plist-put evilmi-plugins mylanguage-mode
           '((evilmi-mylanguage-get-tag evilmi-mylanguage-jump)
             ))
#+END_SRC

Place above code into your ~/.emacs, after the line "(global-evil-matchit-mode 1)"
** Share your code to the world
Tweak your code a little bit to make it a plugin and ask me to merge it into main stream.

Please check "evil-matchit-latext.el" for technical details about plugin.

Key points about code quality of plugin:
- minimum dependency. For example, if your plugin for html template files is only some web-mode API wrapper, it will break when user don't have web-mode
- support emacs 23
- performance is the first priority
