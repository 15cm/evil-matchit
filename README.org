* evil-matchit (current version 0.0.2)

Vim [[http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=39][matchit.vim]] by Benji Fisher ported into Emacs.

(require 'evil-matchit)
(global-evil-matchit-mode 1)

Alternatively, you can enable evil-matchit-mode along a major mode by adding `turn-on-evil-matchit-mode' to the mode hook.

*This package uses Evil as its vi layer*!

* Install
evil-matchit is already uploaded to [[http://marmalade-repo.org/]]. So the best way to install it is using Emacs' package manager.
